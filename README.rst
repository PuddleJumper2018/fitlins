FitLins is a tool for estimating linear models, defined by the
`BIDS Stats Models`_ specification proposal, to `BIDS`_-formatted datasets.

FitLins is developed against `fMRIPrep`_-preprocessed datasets, but is intended to
work with any dataset following the `BIDS Derivatives`_ draft specification.

Example models are available in the `models`_ branch of the main FitLins repository.

This pipeline is developed by the `Poldrack lab at Stanford University
<https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/>`_ for use at the `Center for Reproducible
Neuroscience (CRN) <http://reproducibility.stanford.edu/>`_, as well as for
open-source software distribution.
